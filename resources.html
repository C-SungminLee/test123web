                <p class="text-center"><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My name is Sungmin Lee, and I am running for Sophomore Class President. As Sophomore Class President, I will increase <strong>inclusivity</strong> in events, take <strong>notice </strong>of smaller groups, recognize <strong>people </strong>for their contributions, <strong>understand </strong>the needs and wants of the student body, and provide opportunities for and know the importance of <strong>teen</strong> decisions; in other words, the <strong>I.N.P.U.T.</strong> principles.<br><br><strong>Involve</strong><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To increase the <strong>inclusivity </strong>of school events, I will ensure more opportunities in which students can be involved. Being the freshmen classes' president has taught me many valuable lessons, especially in managing and running events/fundraisers. Also, by being a part of many clubs, like robotics and CSF, I know how powerful it is to feel involved. As Class President, I seek to create a sense of belonging among students so they can feel like they are part of the sophomore class, not just superficially. Additionally, I will have more class events that are connected to the class itself, such as a talent show, and easy to participate events, like a raffle that just only requires a person to wear their class shirt to enter.<br><br><strong>Notice</strong><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Branham, many activities occur, such as sports and clubs, so it can be difficult for students to know when the next event is. I will make sure that people can receive <strong>notice</strong> of events through emails, social media, Remind, and websites so they can stay connected to the class. Furthermore, I will spread awareness for lesser-known clubs and provide opportunities for them to work with the ASB Sophomore Class, especially for clubs run by and for Sophomores. Additionally, I plan on making a Sophomore newsletter where students can be informed on nearing events, important links, and featuring a club of the month; which would have information that the club wants to advertise for 1 month.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>People Recognition&nbsp;</strong><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our school, there are some incredible <strong>people </strong>that deserve recognition. This is why, I will be implementing the “Gifts for Kindness” program, where students will be able to share stories of people that they believe to deserve recognition in the newsletter. Bi-monthly 3 -5 people will be selected to receive gifts (personal goodie bags, bruin gear, etc.).<br><br><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Understanding Needs</strong><br> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As students of Branham, it is important to be accurately represented, to have what you want accounted for. This is why one of my main priorities is to <strong>understand </strong>what the school needs and fulfill them. I will guarantee to provide accessibility for and answer questions and concerns from students. An idea I have is to create Q&amp;A and update videos on Instagram to answer any questions and inform students about upcoming events, clubs, and general news.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><strong>Teen Decisions Matter</strong><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As <strong>teens</strong>, it is important to express opinions and make decisions, because your voice matters. In this upcoming year, I will ensure students can give input and create changes through the classes' Instagram and newsletter.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Voting for the right person is your responsibility, so vote for me. The one who will <strong>include</strong> others, bring <strong>notice</strong>, recognize <strong>people</strong>, <strong>understand</strong> the student body, and knows that <strong>teen </strong>decisions matter. This is why you should vote for me, <strong>Sungmin Lee</strong>, the best choice for the next Sophomore Class President.&nbsp;<br><br><br></p>
