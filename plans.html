                <p class="text-center">To help the class be more involved at school I plan on bringing on more class events that are oriented on connecting the class. Since, if you are have a deeper connection to the class (i.e. more invested) then you are more willing to be <strong>involved</strong>. The class events will be ones that anyone is able to participate in; such as a "Wear your Class shirt Day", in which if you wear a shirt you get free donuts at the quad. Another example would be a Sophomore talent show, in it students will be able to watch the show as a class bonding while participants will be able to win prizes and show the class their talents!</p>

                <p class="text-center">To raise awareness for class events and clubs I plan on using many forms of outreach, which includes&nbsp;<br>canvas,&nbsp;email,&nbsp;remind, social media, and a newsletter. I'll send relevant information about events that students will want to see. Adding one, I'll make opportunities for the ASB Sophomore class to help clubs for and ran by Sophomores, through working with clubs in fundraisers, helping set-up/manage events, advertise about club events, and more. Additionally, every month there will be a club featured with information that club wants posted on the newsletter and the Instagram account. This is because I want to create an environment at Branham in which no one is left behind, in class events and clubs.</p>

                <p class="text-center">I hope to bring more recognition to people who do good deeds in Branham by rewarding them, through a new program called "Gifts for Kindness"! This program is based on giving back to people who share kindness. The way this works is Students will share stories of people that were kind to them through google form and, bi-monthly, 3-5 people will be chosen to receive personalized gifts! Through this people are able to be recognized and rewarded for their actions and kindness is shared.</p>

                <p class="text-center">I want to be able to fully represent the class and have my actions be for the class, not myself. I will provide accessibility for students to ask questions and concerns to me. Furthermore, I won't just be passively listening but actively answering questions through email and Q&amp;A videos on Instagram and the newsletter. This way students are able to get their questions heard and answered effective and efficiently.<br></p>

                <p class="text-center">I believe that everyone's voice matters, especially teens! This is why I will open various ways in which students are able to give their input on class events, fundraisers, and bonding's. I will open up polls and forms through Instagram and the newsletter so students can choice and suggest what types of events <strong>they</strong>&nbsp;want to do! Additionally, all choices that are voted for by students will be kept as options for future class events, this way everyone is able to get what they want!</p>
